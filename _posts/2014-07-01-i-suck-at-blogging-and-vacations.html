title: I Suck at Blogging and Vacations
---

<p>
	Oh my how the time does fly. I haven't kept up with this experiment. I have a terrible history of blogging. I <em>want</em> to blog, but rarely do. Luckily I have continued loosing weight, granted it has slowed down a bit. That is fine, though. It took me thirty years to get this fat, it is bound to take a bit of time to get unfat.
</p>

<p>
	My mantra lately has been <em>more good days then bad days</em>. I recently went on vacation which can almost certainly count as bad days. I drank to excess, ate ice cream, and even drank a can of soda (maybe two). As indulgent as my vacation was, it was exactly what a vacation should be. The difference is that before this year my diet was always in vacation mode. This vacation was only a <em>temporary</em> excursion into gluttony. On returning, I stepped on the scale and found I had only gained two pounds. The key for me is changing what is normal. A normal day is now a good day, and a vacation day is the exception.
</p>

<p>
	For me changing what is a normal day was about defining some simple rules. These rules are not the same as a typical diet. They are not temporary, once I loose all the weight I am hoping they don't suddenly go away. These rules are my new way of life. Like all rules I might bend or break them every now and again, but after six months the rules are already so ingrained in my day to day that I don't have to think about them much. I am hopeful that at some point I will not have to think about them at all.
</p>

<p>
	Everyone's rules will be different, but they should all follow this basic guideline. <strong>Stop doing what is making you fat</strong>. Pretty simple right? Loosing weight isn't rocket science. We all know what is packing on the pounds, we just don't want to change because change is hard. An object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on. To change, you must act.
</p>

<p>
	There is more to my weight loss than just following the rules, but they ground me and set me on the path to a good day. Here are my rules:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>No Fancy Coffee Drinks On Weekdays (Iced Latte, Iced Mocha, etc...)</li>
	<li>No Pastries On Weekdays (Bagels, Doughnuts, Croissants, etc...)</li>
	<li>No Soda</li>
</ol>

	I have been meaning to do a post on some nerdy tools, but that will have to wait until I have some more time. For now here is a sneak preview. A geeky graph (nerds love graphs) that shows how my weight has been trending since the beginning of the year. Only nine pounds to go before I hit my first major goal!
