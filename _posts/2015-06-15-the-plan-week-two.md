title: The Plan - Week Two
---

## Previous Week Recap

The week started out pretty well. Lots of bacon, mmmm. By midweek my blood glucose was well under a 100, as low as 85 one morning which is a good number for me. However starting with some pizza and beer on Thursday evening, the weekend saw a dramatic increase in carb consumption. This wasn't unforseen. I only see my collegues every other month, so when I'm in town it is usually a good a reason to "grab drinks" or do a business dinner. Combined with the first family trip back to MN, there were lots of reasons to celebrate with friends.

The plan did keep me more honest. All my lunch meals had side salads rather than fries, and my weekeday breakfats were all sans pastry. Friday there were plenty of beers, and Saturday and Sunday were both pretty carbful which will stunt my weight loss for a bit.

## Week Two Plan

The beginning of the week is likely to be less than perfect this week. Still traveling through Thursday. The goal is to still stay mostly honest to low carb diet for breakfast and lunch. I plan on cheating w/ beers at dinner at least one night, maybe two this week. 

By the end of the week I'll be home and will tighten the belt a bit, hopefully literally and figuratilvly.
