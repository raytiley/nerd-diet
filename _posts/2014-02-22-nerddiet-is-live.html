<p>
This blog is my wife's idea. One day we were talking about my recent attempt to loose weight and I said something that made her laugh. The statement is best summed up in this tweet.
</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Its nice to hear when people notice that you are loosing weight. However it would be more helpful if people told me I was getting fat.</p>&mdash; raytiley (@raytiley) <a href="https://twitter.com/raytiley/statuses/423499462846058496">January 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

Somehow this evolved into writing a blog about loosing weight. At first I dismissed the idea, but like most ideas my wife has it ended up being too good. The idea wormed its way into my subconceous and here I am, fat, but less fat than I was and writing about it.
</p>

<p>
  I've tried to loose weight before. Dieting, excecising, juicing, even fasting. Nothing seems to stick. The most weight I have ever lost is when I thru-hiked the Appalachian Trail. For those unfamiliar, the Appalachian Trail is a long walk in the mountains from Georgia to Maine. As weight loss plans go hiking a long distance trail is effective but far from pratical.
</p>

<p>
  After the hiking I didn't think much about my weight. As a matter of fact I paid so little attention that since completing the trail I have gained almost one hundred pounds. That is not a typo. When I finished hiking in 2006 I weighed 214 pounds. On January 1st, 2014 I weighed 312.8 pounds.
</p>

<p>
  At the time of writing this blog post I weigh 280.1 pounds. I've lost 32.7 pounds all within the past two months. I realize that is a short amount of time and that I am far from the finish line, but this time feels different.

  Usually when on a weight loss kick I'm obsesing. When am I going to eat next? What am I going to eat? How can I stand being so hungry? Eating one donut is ok if I go running after right?. The theme being that loosing weight is painful, a chore that I need to endure so I can go back to eating <em>normally</em>.

<p>
  I'm still obsessing about my weight loss, but its more enjoyable. I am obsessing about my trend, calorie breakdown, body chemistry, tools I want to code, etc. I'm geeking out over my own body and enjoying it.
</p>

<p>
  What I envision this blog becoming is another tool in helping me geek out about my weight. I'll share what I am doing, what I have done and if it is working. I will probably write some software to share with others, in addition to reviewing blogs, books and software written by others. I do not expect anyone to pay attention, this is soley for my own benefit.

  If you do happen to find yourself reading my blog thanks for taking the time. Please leave a comment and share your thoughts, once I get those working :)
